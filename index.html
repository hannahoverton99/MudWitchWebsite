        Hi there, I'm Hannah Overton, and I am a hobby potter based near St. Louis, Missouri! My journey in ceramics started in 2021 when I took a handbuilding class at a local studio on a whim. I almost instantly fell in love! I have always been a creative person who constantly needed to be making art and new things, but pottery just felt like magic! I kept taking both handbuilding and wheel throwing classes, acquired some of my own equipment, and joined the studio as a firing member. I especially love handbuilding and making mugs and planters. The rest is history!
